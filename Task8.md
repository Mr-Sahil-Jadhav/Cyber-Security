# Cyber-Security Task 8

Aim: To explore how VPNs enhance online privacy and security by encrypting traffic and masking IP addresses, and to experience using a VPN service first-hand.

Software Required:

- A free Vpn(Proton VPN,Windscribe)

- Web Browser

Procedure/Steps:

-Choose a reputable free VPN provider (e.g., ProtonVPN)

-Sign up and install the VPN client

-Connect to a VPN server (preferably the closest or any available region)

-Verify IP change using whatismyipaddress.com

-Browse a secure site to confirm connection and test browsing functionality

-Disconnect the VPN and check:

- Change in IP address

- Difference in browsing speed

- Research the VPN’s encryption protocols and privacy policies

Output:

| Activity              | Observation                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| VPN Used              | ProtonVPN Free                        |
| IP Address Before VPN | 103.XX.XX.101 (India)                 |
| IP Address After VPN  | 45.XX.XX.200 (Netherlands Server)     |
| Speed Change Noticed  | Slight decrease (\~10–15% slower)     |
| Traffic Encryption    | Verified via HTTPS and VPN encryption |


Conclusion:

Benefits Observed:

- IP masking for location privacy

- Encrypted communication, even on public Wi-Fi

- Bypass content restrictions (optional)

Limitations:

- Free VPNs often have limited servers/bandwidth

- Slight browsing speed reduction

- Not foolproof against all forms of surveillance


This task demonstrated the core function of VPNs in protecting user privacy online. While VPNs provide encrypted tunnels and IP obfuscation, they must be combined with other security practices for full protection. Understanding VPN encryption and its practical limits is essential in today’s digital security landscape.
