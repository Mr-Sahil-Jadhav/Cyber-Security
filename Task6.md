# Cyber-Security Task 6

Aim :To understand what makes a password strong, test various passwords using strength checkers, and learn best practices for secure password creation.

Software Required:

-Online Password Strength Checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com)

-Text editor or notes tool to record password test results

Procedure / Steps:

-Create a list of multiple passwords with varying characteristics:

- Simple: password123

- Moderate: Pass1234

- Complex: P@$$w0rD!2024#

-Test each password using an online strength checker

-Record the score/feedback for each password

-Analyze which characters (uppercase, lowercase, symbols, numbers) improved strength

-Note suggestions provided by the tool (e.g., length > 12, avoid dictionary words)

-Research common password attack types:

- Brute Force

- Dictionary Attacks

-Summarize tips learned on how to create secure passwords

Output:

Password             Strength Score

Password123          Weak

Pass1234             Medium

@$$w0rD!2024#        Strong

- Security Tips Identified:

- Use a minimum of 12 characters

- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

- Avoid real words or names

- Use passphrases for better memorability

- Prefer password managers for secure storage

Conclusion:

This task highlighted the importance of password complexity and unpredictability. Through testing, it became evident how minor changes improve strength. Awareness of attack techniques like brute force and dictionary attacks reinforces the need for strong, unique passwords for each account.
